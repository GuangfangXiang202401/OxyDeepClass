# Deep Learning-Based Image Classification of Physiological and Pathological Responses to Hypoxia and High Altitude

This project presents a deep learning-based framework designed for the classification of physiological and pathological responses to hypoxia and high-altitude conditions. The proposed model integrates multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNN) with attention mechanisms to extract hierarchical features from high-dimensional imaging datasets, providing enhanced accuracy in distinguishing between adaptive and maladaptive responses to hypoxia.

## Overview
High-altitude and hypoxic environments induce complex physiological and pathological responses in tissues. Traditional computational methods often struggle to capture the nuanced features of these responses. This project proposes a novel deep learning framework that:

- Utilizes multi-scale convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to capture hierarchical patterns in imaging data.
- Integrates attention mechanisms to improve feature extraction, with a focus on oxygen distribution, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling, and metabolic adaptations.
- Incorporates a hybrid training scheme with interpretability modules to identify key biomarkers and ensure model transparency.

The framework aims to improve the classification of physiological adaptations and disease states caused by hypoxia and high-altitude exposure, which is crucial for high-altitude medicine and hypoxia-related disease diagnostics.

## Features
- **Multi-scale CNN**: Hierarchical feature extraction across multiple scales, enabling the model to capture complex patterns in imaging data.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focuses on critical features related to hypoxia, HIF signaling, and metabolic responses for enhanced classification accuracy.
- **Hybrid Training Scheme**: Combines conventional and domain-specific insights to ensure robust model training.
- **Interpretability Modules**: Identifies key biomarkers and enhances the model's transparency, helping understand how classifications are made.
- **High-altitude and Hypoxia Response Classification**: Effectively distinguishes between adaptive and maladaptive physiological and pathological responses.
